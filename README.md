# PearlyGates

A game about heaven and hell, where you get to be the scales of morality.

## How to play?

Download the repo, and run `main.py` in your Python interpreter of choice. Be 
sure to install the `tracery` library, which is required for the name generator.

## How to contribute?

For the most part, the code in `person.py` is self-explanatory. For example:

 - To add a trait, add an entry to `TRAITS`.
 - To add a set of traits you cannot have at the same time (like misogynist and feminist), add an entry to `EXCLUSIONARY_TRAITS` (see comment above definition).
 - To change the average life expectancy, change `AVERAGE_LIFE_EXPECTANCY`.

The rest of the code may be poorly commented. Sorry, other coders (and future me).
